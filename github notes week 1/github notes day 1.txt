>copy a commit to repository


*what is a merge conflicts
> ex: youre working in a team and dev a and dev b both were making new changes and dev one pushed a changes,and dev b then too tried to push the changes its gonna be a merge conflict

>>solution ether choose between which one is better or simply merge both of the code manually and then again push it



*what is a branch
>its a exact duplicate of main branches(master repo) code


*steps to create a repo in cmd

>Create a Repo on GitHub (Website)

Go to GitHub → log in.

Click + (top-right) → New repository.

Name it (e.g., dataops_day1)

DO NOT check “Initialize with README” (we’ll push our local files instead).

Click Create repository.


If you already have a project folder:

>cd path/to/your/project {in your computer}
>git nit
>git add .
>





If you want to create a fresh folder:

>mkdir dataops_day1
>cd dataops_day1
>git init
>touch README.md
>git add README.md
>git commit -m "Initial commit"
