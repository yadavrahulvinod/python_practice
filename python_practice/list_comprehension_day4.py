"LIST COMPREHENSION BELOW"

"""
List comprehension is a shorter and cleaner way to create lists in Python.

Instead of writing a full for loop, you can generate lists in one line.

ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax
******[expression for item in iterable if condition]******

expression â†’ what you want in the list

item â†’ variable from the loop

iterable â†’ list, range, string, etc.

if condition (optional) â†’ filter items
